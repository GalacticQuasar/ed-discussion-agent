## Features (to implement)
- Agent provides Ed discussion links as references (render directly in interface?)
- Agent should use filters on Ed discussion
- Notification system (agent has tool to send email when it finds new post on topic)

# Use Cases to think about
- "Tell me everything I need to know about homework 5"
    - Should compile a list of tips/advice from relevant posts
- "Notify me when the lecture recording for week 7 is posted"
    - Agent should be able to send email notification when new post is made with lecture recording link
    - Could generalize to "Notify me when there's a due date extension" for any assignment
- General/Continuous: Create markdown formatted report on all discussion activity (group by homework, project, exam)
    - Could store in structured format (YAML/JSON) for easy parsing
